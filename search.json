    "text": "My move to industry from academia was facilitated by completing LC101 from LaunchCode. My LC101 training was huge and I’ve used it to build a web app that helps you track your tasks and solve numerous problems with bespoke solutions for clients.\nPrior to my work in industry, I taught courses in Ethics (including Computer, Legal, Business, and Medical Ethics) as well as Social and Political Philosophy, and interdisciplinary courses on Emotion. For more details, see my Teaching page.\nAdditionally, I’ve published work on moral responsibility, punishment, emotion, technology, and related issues. For more, see my Research page.\nFinally, a brief educational history: I received my BA from St. Louis University, my MA from the University of Cincinnati, and my PhD from The Ohio State University."

    "text": "Before every class meeting, I require students to respond to the readings by submitting posts to the course website that seek clarification about or challenge a claim in the assigned readings. This enables me to tailor discussion of the material to student difficulties and interests. I spend class time walking students through how to write an analytical paper and show them how to think of objections and replies that need to be considered. This means students are able to do original thinking and provide argumentation that does not just parrot the material they have read. Further, I always require students to write rough drafts and participate in peer review before submitting their final drafts. Students are more motivated when their peers will see their work, and the chance to revise with peer feedback always makes their work better. I emphasize that revising is more than just making editorial changes. Real revising can require tearing a paper apart to get at its central argument and then rewriting the paper around a new line of reasoning. By the end of the term, students make significant progress in writing a clear and forcefully argued philosophy paper.\nTo further assist in digesting the difficult source material and to supplement our weekly class meetings, I offer video webcasts of all course meetings for students to review. If students fail to grasp a point in class, they can review the class meeting later. The webcasts are also beneficial because students who have to miss class can easily review what they missed. I find that questions in office hours are more focused on a deeper understanding of the material when students review the lectures before we meet. Finally, using the video feeds helps me to improve my pedagogy by giving me a student’s view of my classroom.\nBy structuring assignments and classroom interaction in these ways, I aim to create an environment where I inculcate in students an appreciation for and an interest in philosophy, help them achieve clarity in their thoughts and writing, facilitate students’ understanding of the arguments relevant to an issue, and model respect for others and their ideas."

    "text": "My philosophical researched aims to articulate a comprehensive theory of moral responsibility: an account of the nature and norms of holding people morally responsible. I approach these issues with a distinctive, interdisciplinary methodology. I maintain that any adequate theory of moral responsibility must attend to philosophical argument as well as results from the empirical sciences. In my published work I solve a vexing problem for extant accounts of trust, invoke psychological work on the blaming emotions to show that we have several different conceptions of moral responsibility, pull from a variety of empirical and philosophical sources to develop a nuanced account of angry virtue and vice, articulate the grounds on which emotions like resentment and indignation are deserved by their targets, develop a plausible theory of punishment’s justification, and explain how forgiveness can be both possible and warranted."
