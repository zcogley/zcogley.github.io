I'm a Senior Solutions Consultant and AI Ethicist at [Spectrum Labs](https://spectrumlabsai.com){target="_blank"}, a leading Natural Language Understanding AI company whose mission is to make the Internet a safer and more valuable place for all. At Spectrum, I work with the Solutions, Product, and Data Science teams to ensure Spectrum Labs customers — who span gaming, social media, dating apps and brands — utilize all of Spectrum’s features to keep their online communities safe. 

Before coming to Spectrum, I was previously Director of Customer Success at [Balto](https://balto.ai){target="_blank"}, Associate Professor at [Northern Michigan University](https://nmu.edu){target="_blank"}, and Lecturer at [UCLA](https://ucla.edu){target="_blank"}.

My move to industry from academia was facilitated by completing [LC101](https://www.launchcode.org/lc101){target="_blank"} from [LaunchCode](http://www.launchcode.org){target="_blank"}. I've used my LC101 training and additional work in python, pandas, and numpy to solve numerous problems for clients with bespoke solutions. 

Prior to my work in industry, I taught courses in Ethics (including Computer, Emerging Technology, Legal, Business, and Medical Ethics) as well as Social and Political Philosophy, and interdisciplinary courses on Emotion. For more details, see my [Teaching](teaching.qmd) page. 

Additionally, I've published work on moral responsibility, punishment, emotion, technology, and related issues. For more, see my [Research](research.qmd) page.

Finally, a brief educational history: I received my BA from [St. Louis University](https:www.slu.edu){target="_blank"}, my MA from [University of Cincinnati](https://www.uc.edu){target="_blank"}, and my PhD from [The Ohio State University](https://www.osu.edu){target="_blank"}.
