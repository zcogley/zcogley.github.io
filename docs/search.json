    "text": "I’m a Customer Success Engineer at Hiya, a leading Voice Security Platform for Spam Fraud, and Call Spoofing prevention as well as a provider of Branded Calling. I work with the Customer Success, Product, and Engineering teams to ensure Hiya customers – who span Financial, Retail, Healthcare, and Insurance brands – fully utilize all of Hiya’s features.\nBefore coming to Hiya, I was previously Senior Solutions Consultant and AI Ethicist at Spectrum Labs, Director of Customer Success at Balto, Associate Professor at Northern Michigan University, and Lecturer at UCLA.\nMy move to industry from academia was facilitated by completing LC101 from LaunchCode. I’ve used my LC101 training and additional work in python, pandas, and numpy to solve numerous problems for clients with bespoke solutions.\nPrior to my work in industry, I taught courses in Ethics (including Computer, Emerging Technology, Legal, Business, and Medical Ethics) as well as Social and Political Philosophy, and interdisciplinary courses on Emotion. For more details, see my Teaching page.\nAdditionally, I’ve published work on moral responsibility, punishment, emotion, technology, and related issues. For more, see my Research page.\nFinally, a brief educational history: I received my BA from St. Louis University, my MA from University of Cincinnati, and my PhD from The Ohio State University.\ntest"

    "text": "I have two main active research programs: ethical issues related to AI and moral responsibility.\nMy AI ethics research seeks to understand how, when, and whether to deploy AI technologies in morally defensible ways.\nMy moral responsiiblity research aims to articulate a comprehensive theory of moral responsibility: an account of the nature and norms of holding people morally responsible. I approach these issues with a distinctive, interdisciplinary methodology. I maintain that any adequate theory of moral responsibility must attend to philosophical argument as well as results from the empirical sciences. In my published work I solve a vexing problem for extant accounts of trust, invoke psychological work on the blaming emotions to show that we have several different conceptions of moral responsibility, pull from a variety of empirical and philosophical sources to develop a nuanced account of angry virtue and vice, articulate the grounds on which emotions like resentment and indignation are deserved by their targets, develop a plausible theory of punishment’s justification, and explain how forgiveness can be both possible and warranted.\n\nREFEREED JOURNAL ARTICLES\n\nReasons to Punish Autonomous Robots.
